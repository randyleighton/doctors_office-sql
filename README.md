Doctors Office 
==============
#This project is created in ruby using postgreSQL.
Create a doctor office database.
  add tables for doctors, patients, insurance, specialties, and finally appointments.
  
This project creates ruby objects with the data it queries from the database, and all
changes are made to the database and objects are re-created.

#This project uses Test Driven development to develop all code.

Initial work is not creating a UI, focusing on the TDD and code generation first.

Project created by Randy Leighton paired with Xolani Mfuko and Diego Garcia.
